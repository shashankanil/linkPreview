This is especially true for the millions of informal and migrant labourers, who now find themselves unemployed, marooned, and literally dying of hunger . India is now witnessing possibly the largest human migration on foot , since Partition. On Day 4 of the lockdown, we watched a stampede-like situation unfold at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border, where thousands of migrant workers jostled one another to find seats on buses travelling to their home villages. What followed was a lesson in how not to manage the mounting crisis. Kerala has taken several measures to ensure the health and safety of its informal workers. Instead, we might want to turn our attention towards the south, to the state of Kerala, where today, 4,603 relief camps are housing 1,44,145 migrant labourers . Here, efforts to cater to the needs of \u2018guest workers\u2019, as they are called there, began almost as soon as the novel coronavirus hit the state in end January. From leveraging local government to provide food and basic amenities, set up community kitchens, and distribute food kits, to appointing senior IAS officers at the state level to oversee these efforts, Kerala has taken several measures to ensure the health and safety of its informal workers. Till date, the state has had a total of 213 positive cases, and has been among the most proactive when it comes to testing, contact tracing, and communication.",

This has a direct impact on the safety and dignity of sanitation workers, especially during the current pandemic. When the lockdown was announced, sanitation workers found themselves clubbed together with healthcare workers, the media, and police, as categories of people who were exempt from the lockdown and expected to discharge their duties as usual. They were also counted as \u2018frontline\u2019 workers, along with healthcare workers.However, they have not received the same amount of attention, in terms of having access to protective gear or logistics support (food, water, rest, finances, transport, and so on).

        "text": "So many degrees, so few jobs India\u2019s graduates face heightened challenges with millions of projected layoffs and fewer job openings. Here\u2019s how we can prepare graduates for a post-COVID-19 economy. By now, it is common knowledge that India\u2019s nationwide lockdown has disrupted businesses across all sectors. We, at TechnoServe, expect that states will enforce partial lockdowns to contain re-emergences of community infection at different points of time. This\u2018start-stop\u2019system in the Indian economy will continue until the pandemic is contained through mass vaccination or improved disease preparedness and response. The need for an interim start-stop economy will prevail for 18-24 months, and is expected to result in an economic slowdown through 2020-22.1Graduates\u2014who havehistorically struggledin India\u2019s job market\u2014will face heightened challenges during this period. Based on ourprojections, additional incumbent graduates will be subject to unexpected terminations or pay freezes, while those entering the workforce between 2020 and 2022 will see fewer job opportunities. However, before we dive into the details of COVID-19\u2019s expected impact on graduates, it is important to understand the dynamics of India\u2019s job market before the onset of COVID-19.Related article: Managing your career during COVID-19A snapshot of graduate employment pre-COVID-19As of January 2020, we estimate that there are120 million individualswith graduate degrees or above in India. Around 74 million of these graduates are employed, with approximately 40 percent in the formal sector and 60 percent in the informal sector. The government, private sector, and the education sector are the largest formal sector employers, with roughly 11 million, 10 million, and eight million graduates, respectively.\n\nSocio-cultural barriers remain a predominant driver of gendered employment outcomes, as women graduates are often expected to be homemakers in spite of their educational qualifications.Rural graduates, who make up approximately33 percentof the pool of incumbent graduates, face unemployment and workforce dropout rates that are1.5 to 2 times higherthan that of their urban counterparts. Rural-urban disparities stem in part from limited graduate-level jobs outside of major cities.Graduates from marginalised backgroundsstruggle to secure formal sector jobs. Those from poorer families face greater socio-cultural barriers at school, which hinder academic and post-graduation outcomes. For example, these students often have fewer relatable mentors, limited networks into formal sector careers, and face greater pressure to follow their family trades. Moreover, they may lack access to infrastructure, such as smartphones, laptops, or high-speed internet, which are required to build 21st century skills.Graduates across all of these groups will grow over the next few years. As of 2018, there were37.4 million studentsenrolled in graduate programs and beyond. From this figure, we estimate that 7.5 to 8 million new graduates will be added to the workforce annually between 2020 and 2022.2Of these new graduates, approximately48 percentwill be female and60 percentwill be from rural institutions.3Graduates\u2014who have historically struggled in India\u2019s job market\u2014will face heightened challenges during this period. | Picture courtesy: PixabayThe impact of COVID-19 on graduate employmentThe COVID-19-induced economic downturn will further hurt employment prospects for both incumbent and new graduates.

To identify appropriate interventions, we conductedthree-year projectionsto assess COVID-19\u2019s impact on graduate employability.Graduates completing their degrees between 2020 and 2022 are expected to see 3.1 million fewer job openings as they enter the workforce.These forecasts were constructed using a combination of graduate employment data, historical benchmarks, first-hand interviews, and analyst reports on COVID-19\u2019s expected impact across industries and sub-sectors. The forecasts provide directional insight on the magnitude of employment loss, as well as the groups of graduates who are most vulnerable to COVID-19-induced job reductions.Overall, we project that up to 4.4 million incumbent graduates will lose their jobs in 2020, with only 50 percent re-hired by 2022. Moreover, graduates completing their degrees between 2020 and 2022 are expected to see 3.1 million fewer job openings as they enter the workforce.Impact on incumbent graduates:Projected job losses will be split equally between the informal sector and formal sector. Within the formal sector, private sector jobs are expected to drive the majority of losses (1.2 million), with the most layoffs in financial services (0.4 million) and manufacturing (0.2 million). Although industries such as hospitality and tourism are anticipated to experience the greatest percentage increase in layoffs (up to 40 percent), the disproportionate impact on financial services and manufacturing is driven by the high absolute employment of graduates in these fields.Impact on new graduates from the classes of 2020-2022:Projected job reductions will be most severe for the class graduating in 2020, which is expected to face 1.",

Even before the pandemic, general unemployment was a cause for concern, reaching a 45-year high in 2019. India was witnessing increased informalisation of jobs as firms fired workers because they could not afford to keep them on the payroll, or saw an opportunity to reduce labour costs, before the pandemic-induced economic recession, experts said , and the second wave made the situation worse. Over the last two years, millions of jobs have been lost and workers\u2019 livelihoods, particularly in the informal and unorganised sector, have been adversely impacted by measures to control the Covid-19 pandemic. As we move into a year where uncertainty over the threat of the Omicron variant of concern and a possible third wave looms, we assess the status of the workforce and labour and employment policies in India. Dearth of good quality data on workers Well before the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, in August 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) had ordered the government to create a national portal for registering unorganised workers so that they could access welfare benefits. Unorganised workers make up the vast majority of India\u2019s workforce, at 93% . In June 2021, nearly three years after its order, the SC, while responding to a petition on issues migrant workers faced after the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed, noted the delay in setting up the portal, and said that while unorganised workers were awaiting registration and attendant welfare benefits, the \u201clackadaisical attitude by the Ministry of Labour and Employment is unpardonable\u201d.\n\nIn June 2021, nearly three years after its order, the SC, while responding to a petition on issues migrant workers faced after the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed, noted the delay in setting up the portal, and said that while unorganised workers were awaiting registration and attendant welfare benefits, the \u201clackadaisical attitude by the Ministry of Labour and Employment is unpardonable\u201d.

Over two-thirds of India\u2019s informal workforce are thus yet to be registered. Moreover, the informal workforce per some estimates is higher than the government\u2019s target. For instance, it was 415.6 million-strong in 2018-19, per Azim Premji University\u2019s State of Working India (SWI) 2021 re port . Workers were facing challenges during registration, including due to mandated use of Aadhaar-linked mobile numbers,\u00a0IndiaSpend reported\u00a0in November 2021. Since the lockdown-induced reverse migration , the condition of migrant workers, many of whom work in the informal economy, has been a cause of concern . It is estimated that nearly 11.4 million migrants have returned home till date. Yet, even two years after the Covid-19-induced lockdown, gaps in data on migrant workers persist despite efforts to step up data gathering . The government told Parliament in December 2021 that it has limited information on migrant workers.",

It\u2019s time to advocate for laws and policies that protect their interests. by Aditi Yajnik , Sanjana Haribhakti The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought many lives to a standstill. In addition to grave health repercussions, it has resulted in a deluge of socio-economic and humanitarian suffering due to lockdowns and restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. As policymakers grapple with these conflicting pressures, millions of informal workers\u2014domestic workers included\u2014have faced tremendous uncertainty with regard to their work and income. Despite an easing of lockdown restrictions across India after the first wave, 45 percent of domestic workers faced some form of job loss. From those who managed to keep their jobs, many had to accept lower wages and faced working conditions fraught with health and safety risks. Despite the launch of the national vaccination drive, domestic workers have been left wondering about the accessibility of vaccines. Runaben, a migrant worker from Bihar, was concerned that vaccine side effects could cost domestic workers (and other daily wage workers) two days of paid work. \u201c Behen, aise time mei jaha kaam ki kami hai, agar ussmei teeka lenge aur do din chutti bhi, toh ghar kaise chalega?\u201d (At a time where there is already a shortage of work, if we get vaccinated and have to miss two days of work, how will we run our households?).

Here\u2019s how the pandemic impacted their access to the labour market. by Siddharth Ganguly In the first article in this two-part series, we looked at the findings on discrimination in India\u2019s labour market detailed in Oxfam\u2019s India Discrimination Report 2022 . While that article detailed the extent of discrimination faced by Muslims, Women and members of the SC/ST community under \u2018normal\u2019 circumstances, this part focuses on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the extent of discrimination these communities face. When the coronavirus pandemic touched down in India in March 2020, the subsequent nationwide lockdown had a devastating impact on employment. The unemployment rate in the country went from 6.8% in Jan-March, 2020 (henceforth referred to as the pre-pandemic quarter; PPQ) to 12.1% in April-June (first pandemic quarter; FPQ). The impact was more severe in urban areas than in rural ones since lockdown measures hit urban businesses more severely. Unemployment in urban areas rose from 9% in the PPQ to 20.8% in the FPQ. However, urban areas saw a more-or-less consistent increase in unemployment across social groups; in rural areas, marginalised groups bore the brunt of the unemployment. It should be noted that the figures mentioned above refer to employment as defined in the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS); as those seeking and available for work. This definition may not paint the most accurate picture since there were some individuals in regular and self-employment who were not included under this definition, despite reporting no work or income.",

The women in the group were not only connected to a rural bank for a loan to invest in their enterprise, but they also received training on running the business\u2014for example, how to operate the machine and handle packaging, accounts, registers, and so on. A local enterprise provided a warranty and services the machine within 24 hours of a breakdown. During COVID-19, the larger mills shut down because transportation restrictions cut down their access to larger markets and diesel became unavailable for their generators. The mill set up by the Kisan Mahila Mandal SHG, however, has been running regularly, securing livelihoods for the farmers and ensuring local families still have food to eat. Why communities need local entrepreneurs and local energy services The first half of 2020 has seen global economies erode . The COVID-19 pandemic has destroyed numerous hard-earned developmental gains, particularly in impoverished communities. It has also proven that many of the safety nets built for people living in poverty have not been strong enough. A recent survey released in India reported that around 67 per cent of workers had lost livelihoods during the pandemic, and many more had seen loss in their incomes. This leads us to question whether the systems we built in the past were enough. Do we need to rebuild them, or should we rethink them completely? Innovations for people living in poverty have to be decentralised and customised.",

        "text": "Currently, there is little evidence to show the extent of the mental health crisis unfolding in the country. Preliminary evidence from 413 low-income households in Delhi shows that 65 percent of\u00a0women reported feeling depressed and 75 percent felt anxious or nervous about their situation. While this is a small sample in an urban area, it points towards worrisome trends. We need to find out more and must desegregate evidence to account for how the crisis is affecting different sections of the society differently. The impact of isolation, social distancing, and the loss of loved ones will stay with us for years to come. However, we must prepare and put in place resources to deal with our collective mental health concerns, which have only exacerbated in the second wave of the pandemic in India. A good place to start would be to generate robust evidence on mental health concerns across urban and rural India. COVID-19 has fractured communities and deepened pre-existing inequalities. The socio-economic impacts of this pandemic have been widespread and have threatened to reverse decades of developmental progress, especially for women and children. As we recover and rebuild our economies, we should keep the most vulnerable at the centre of our efforts and build back more equal. \u2014 Footnotes : Presentation, Giorgia Barboni.

While the funds rose by approximately 25 percent between FY 2008\u201309 and FY 2009\u201310, they fell sharply after FY 2011\u201312. Funds rose consistently from FY 2014\u201315 to FY 2019\u201320, but fell again in FY 2020\u201321. Over the years, the amount of pending liabilities (accumulated payments) due or expenditure incurred by the states over and above available funds has been increasing . These liabilities have accumulated as a result of delays in payments for both wages and material costs and are to be reimbursed by the central government. Funds available under MGNREGS have failed to keep up with expenditures incurred and are constantly exhausted before the end of the fiscal year. New projects to be implemented are also continually added even as previous projects are left unfinished. This leads to inefficient utilisation of funds. View a detailed statistical analysis of the MGNREGA budget for FY 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 here . Read about how issues with government payment systems cause delays. How did MGNREGA fare during the pandemic? The onset of COVID-19 was a major challenge for unskilled workers. There are approximately 139 million internal migrant workers in India, and most of them are daily-wage labourers. The struggle to earn a daily wage to make ends meet, unorganised employment, and lack of financial security are just some of the issues that plague India\u2019s internal migrants. These issues were further exacerbated during the pandemic as the lockdown brought manufacturing to a standstill. This triggered a mass exodus of workers who returned to their villages due to lack of work.",

In this moment of transition lies a chance for businesses across every state to reimagine their purpose and role in creating the \u2018new normal\u2019 that we need to see. We suggest five points to consider: Related article: Supporting informal workers during the COVID-19 crisis 1. Address the plight of migrant and informal workers Informal workers form nearly 90 percent of India\u2019s 500 million workforce, yet they are excluded from many legal or contractual protections that form a crucial safety net in times of crisis. Businesses need to ensure that the most vulnerable\u2014and most essential\u2014workers in their value chains are protected, by creating a radically different social contract with informal workers. A good place to start is by seeking out and supporting current initiatives in your region or sector to protect informal workers, such as Kerala\u2019s efforts led by the labour commissioner Pranabjyoti Nath to document migrant labourers to protect their rights, or Rajasthan-based Aajeevika Bureau that works to solve the legal and socio-economic problems that migrant workers face. Being part of leading initiatives can help you create a better understanding of the complex issues facing the informal work sector, understand the evolving options, and build on best practices. Next, bring insights back into your organisation to ensure that you have an effective, well-implemented, and comprehensive human rights policy that focuses on tenure security, fair wages, and investment in upskilling contract labourers. Since 2011, the Indian government has introduced guidelines such as the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) that begin to articulate business\u2019 social responsibility towards all key stakeholders, including but not limited to shareholders.",

The crisis in urban livelihoods precipitated by Covid-19 is of unprecedented proportions. Numerousreports and surveyshave revealed that urban informal sector workers were the worst hit by loss of employment during the lockdown. At the time, the absence of any social protection measures for these workers was acutely felt. The continued economic slowdown and the lack of adequate creation of new jobs shows that the informal sector workers in the urban areas are yet to experience a recovery from their losses during the lockdown.At the national level, the government\u2019s response by way of employment support has focussed on increased allocations to theMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act(MGNREGA) programme and thePM Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojanathat is aimed at returning migrant workers. While these are, of course, important steps, a large urban public job creation programme with an employment guarantee is urgently needed.There were several news reports in September suggesting that the central government was looking at introducing an urban employment guarantee (UEG) programme as a means of providing basic income security to the millions of urban workers who had lost their jobs during the pandemic (seethis,thisandthis). Subsequently, a few op-eds have appeared infavour ofandagainstthis course of action.Related article: How has NREGA fared during lockdown?While these debates continue, several states have already launched urban employment programmes.",

        "text": "May 05 Economic fallout of the second wave likely to be more severe The second wave of COVID-19 has reached India\u2019s hinterland, with the share of cases in rural India on the rise. Lack of quality testing facilities and healthcare infrastructure combined with a largely high risk, older population could result in mayhem as the disease spreads. With steady consumption levels, rural India was able to reign in the economic impact of the first wave. However, rising fear and spread might make it difficult to sell produce and services, limiting income streams and worsening the economic impact. Experts also note that the impact on rural India\u2013the humanitarian crisis, loss of incomes, and resultant debt traps\u2013will not be captured in GDP figures immediately. Acute stress on resources, without a stimulus package from the government, will make it harder for rural India to sustain the economic shock and further stunt recovery. May 04 Delays in distributing emergency COVID-19 supplies Emergency COVID-19 relief supplies\u2014oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and medicines\u2014received from various countries landed in Delhi by April 30th, 2021 . However, state officials from seven states reported that they hadn\u2019t received any supplies nor had any information about their allotment from the Centre until May 3rd. Referrals and resulting queries made to the health ministry went unanswered. An anonymous source reported that the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) that handles clearance, doesn\u2019t have adequate personnel to carry out such a large-scale relief operation and that bottlenecks in the customs clearing process, despite a waiver on duties, was holding up aid clearance. Given the acute shortage and dire need of these supplies, timely allocation could save lives.\n\nThe devastating economic impact has been compounded by the lack of institutional access to credit and income support and increased borrowing to save for future uncertainties and cover essential needs. Borrowing was primarily to run households and cover rising medical costs in the absence of public healthcare. Further, lack of access to formal credit lines has forced families to borrow from riskier informal sources. Creating better access to formal credit, providing income support, and incorporating tech-based financing options are immediate measures needed to weather the impact of this mounting debt crisis. May 18 Rebuild people\u2019s trust in public systems Without adequate testing and healthcare facilities, rural India is grappling with the second wave of COVID-19. Experts believe that rebuilding people\u2019s trust in public systems, encouraging home care, and using simple technology could contain this surge. Every MP and MLA must ensure that their constituency has testing facilities, the local administration must engage with the communities and motivate frontline staff, and Panchayats must encourage social distancing and other COVID-appropriate behaviour. Stigma associated with COVID-19 leading to death by suicide Fear and stigma associated with COVID-19 infection is leading to social boycott of patients in some rural areas. Along with being ostracised, many patients are also struggling with monetary aid for medicines and treatment. The resulting distress has led to some cases of death by suicide . The rise in stigma associated with COVID-19 must be tackled through awareness campaigns. May 13 COVID-19 is rippling through Indian prisons The second wave of COVID-19 has hit Indian prisons hard, with more than 2,800 inmates already infected. Recognising this, the Supreme Court has ordered state authorities to limit arrests and decongest prisons. Bottlenecks such as limited functioning of courts, procedural hurdles, and arrests during the lockdown have resulted in the continued overcrowding of prisons.",

A slum\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics influence its community engagement The legal, political, and physical qualities of a slum, as well as the social capital of its residents, determine a community\u2019s vulnerability to the pandemic and the extent of its engagement. Notified slums such as Dharavi house largely permanent settlements, where many residents own their homes and have strong formal and informal networks within the community. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and nonprofits such as the Society for Nutrition, Health, and Education Action (SNEHA) are partnering with community volunteers and leaders in Dharavi to assist residents with essential public services, financial support, and COVID-19 health services. Also, Dharavi\u2019s relatively better infrastructure\u2014in terms of water and health facilities\u2014and its political capital enabled its communities to collectively tackle the pandemic. Community roles often shift during shocks such as pandemics During the COVID-19 pandemic, economically thriving and engaged slum communities, such as parts of Dharavi, have become recipients of food, basic services, and psycho-social support. On the other hand, some slum leaders and residents in Dharavi also took proactive and lead roles in supporting the BMC with health screenings, contact tracing, and sharing COVID-19 prevention measures in communities.",

Migration\u2014within and across states\u2014 improves the socioeconomic status of people, benefiting the destinations as well as home sites of migrants. So why does India have a lower rate of interstate migration compared to other countries with similar economic development indices? As per one study ,\u00a0this could partly be due to \u201cmigrant unfriendly policies\u201d in the country. Across industries and sectors, migrants work for lower wages in worse living conditions, with scarce to no \u201c legal, linguistic, and social support mechanisms \u201d. Nearly all migrants in India were affected by the shrinkage in urban jobs\u00a0post COVID-19. Many of these migrants were part of the informal workforce\u2014working in factories and at construction sites, for example\u2014which made their situation more precarious. In the face of such circumstances, many migrants were forced to return home. Even as the country began to get back on its feet after the lockdowns, some migrants decided to stay back in their native areas. The uncertainty around future lockdowns and unfavourable reports from their peers who did go back to cities were among the primary drivers of this decision.",

This gender disparity in employment recovery was found to be starkest in rural India, where women belonging to low-income households did\u00a0not experience anywhere near the same level of job recovery as low-income earning men. According to the study, only four percent of men, compared to 11 percent of women, in rural India were yet to recover their paid work. 2. Women faced a greater loss in income during COVID-19 On average, women lost over two-thirds of their incomes and experienced deeper loss and slower recovery in paid work when compared to men. The income recovery rate may look similar, with men at 23 percent and women at 27 percent below their baseline incomes in September-October 2020. However, women started at a much lower baseline of INR 5,000, as opposed to INR 8,000 for men, which significantly impacted their ability to withstand the shock of income loss. 3 . Unpaid labour and care work increased for women Women\u2019s unpaid responsibilities at home and other forms of unpaid work such as cattle rearing or farm labour are recognised as some of the biggest barriers preventing them from getting into, remaining in, and progressing in the labour force. One of the documented effects of unpaid work is having less time to perform paid work\u2014women spend disproportionately more time than men doing unpaid care work, making it difficult for them to work otherwise.

What are some policy interventions that can support a gender-inclusive employment recovery? by Vineet Bhandari , Swetha Totapally The employment crisis became an unfortunate consequence, as India cycled through lockdowns of varying severity and duration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate, at approximately 7.2 percent in January 2020, shot up to 23.5 percent in April 2020, and fluctuated over the year to end at about seven percent (up from approximately 5.3 percent in 2019). Based on these numbers, it would seem that employment has recovered to some extent. However, a closer look at the situation reveals a clear gender bias in this recovery, especially for women from low-income households. In October and November 2020, Dalberg conducted one of the largest studies around the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on women from low-income households, analysing data of more than 17,000 respondents from across 10 Indian states. The study was primarily based on telephonic interviews, supported by evidence from other studies wherever needed. Here are some key findings from the study: 1 . A higher percentage of women experienced job losses Although women made up just 24 percent of those working before the pandemic, they accounted for 28 percent of those who lost work, and 43 percent of those yet to recover their paid work in November 2020. This gender disparity in employment recovery was found to be starkest in rural India, where women belonging to low-income households did\u00a0not experience anywhere near the same level of job recovery as low-income earning men.",

One hundred and eleven youth-serving organisations in India shared their experiences with reported health-related concerns and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. by Shireen Jejeebhoy , Nitya Daryanani , Sucharita Iyer COVID-19 has developed into an unprecedented public health crisis, the impact of which has been seen across global health systems and services. As the crisis continues to evolve in India, there is a need to examine the impact of the pandemic and ensuing nation-wide shutdown on young people\u2019s lives, particularly, their experience of mental ill health. The Dasra Adolescents Collaborative conducted a survey of 111 youth-serving organisations, working with more than 32 lakh young people, to better understand their perspectives on the experiences of the people they serve. The survey asked organisations about whether one or more of the boys and girls they work with had reported health-related concerns, challenges in obtaining services, and the variations in the incidences of these challenges, both before and after the onset of the pandemic. It also asked about actions taken, if any, to improve the situation. This article draws on the findings from the survey, with a focus on programme implications relating to health and access to care during the lockdown. Related article: Mental health and COVID-19 in India Mental ill health The United Nations has reported a rapid global rise in mental ill-health since the pandemic began. Additionally, research has indicated that prolonged quarantine periods can have a lasting negative impact on psychological well-being and, for adolescents and young people, an increased risk of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as well as anxious and depressive symptoms.",

She says, \u201cWhile the pandemic has had many other repercussions, remote work has actually played out quite well for the LedBy cohorts. Many of the women we work with had restrictions on their travel earlier. During the lockdowns, a number of them said, \u2018I am able to work comfortably because I can do it from home.\u2019\u201d Since the pandemic made remote work a possibility, young Muslim women from Tier-I and Tier-II cities\u2014whose families were otherwise wary of letting them go to metropolitan areas in search of work\u2014were able to tap into the job market. In fact, the participants of LedBy\u2019s leadership programme continue to negotiate for remote and hybrid work even as employers are reopening physical offices. Deepanjali worries that as jobs go offline again, seeking employment may be difficult for hijabi Muslim women as some employers have previously asked them to do away with the hijab at workplaces. However, only a fraction of the Muslim population in India has the higher education required for formal sector jobs, where employees have the luxury of remote work. The majority of Muslims in the country are employed in the informal sector , where there are fewer choices and safeguards.

Migrant workers from the community also remained invisible. by Debojit Dutta , Jasmine Bal READ THIS ARTICLE IN English English Hindi Read article in Hindi Social structures have always played a role in widening economic divides, and the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse for those marginalised by gender, religion, caste, and their intersections. Muslim women, who constitute only one-tenth of the working women population in India, bore the brunt of hate campaigns , hiring biases , and state-sanctioned demolition drives . We spoke with nonprofit leaders and activists working with Muslim women workers in India and found that even though all women from the community faced challenges in finding and sustaining employment, their struggles varied based on factors such as their socio-economic status, level of education, and the sector they were employed in. Muslim women from the middle and upper classes with higher education degrees did comparatively better and even saw some positive developments during the pandemic, while those from low-income groups struggled for money and had to start working to make up for the loss of family income . The migrant workers in the informal sector were the most disadvantaged because in addition to the other challenges, they lacked a social security net. In a way, the pandemic again showed that even within the marginalised communities, one\u2019s social location plays a critical role in defining lives and livelihoods.

Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) suggests that the urban unemployment rate neared 12 percent in the week leading up to May 9, 2021\u2014up from 9.5 percent in the week ending April 25. In April 2021, India\u2019s labour force participation rate fell to 39.9 percent. This is the third consecutive month for which it has fallen and is the lowest since May 2020. Experience from the past year, when the urban unemployment rate shot up to nearly 25 percent in April 2020, puts the precarious nature of urban employment into sharp focus. This is particularly so for informal workers, nearly 80 percent of whom lost their livelihoods during April and May 2020, as per the State of Working India 2021 report. The economic shock due to the second wave might further worsen the unemployment crisis. Women were disproportionately impacted by the economic shock of the pandemic last year, as COVID-19 guidelines prevented work in sectors like construction, beauty and wellness, domestic work, sex work, among others. Estimates suggest that nearly 70 percent of women in the working population in December 2019 had lost their jobs by April 2020, compared to 35 percent of men.",

Here are recommendations for the central and state governments to alleviate the situation. by India Development Review Every year, around nine million workers move from rural areas to cities in search of work at construction sites and factories. In fact, the construction sector currently employs 55 million daily-wage workers (the highest number of migrant workers across India), and contributes to approximately eight percent 1 of the country\u2019s GDP. As we know, the effect of the countrywide lockdown on daily wage workers has been catastrophic: industries shutting down have rendered workers unemployed across the country, the sudden announcement of the lockdown has denied migrant workers the opportunity to collect their wages or make arrangements for going home to their villages, and a closing of transportation facilities has left them trapped in cities without enough resources. The result: 92.5 percent of the labourers surveyed had already lost anywhere between one to three weeks of work. Based on their average day rate, this translates into an estimated income loss between INR 4,000-10,000 per worker.

Fatigue, despair, and deep mistrust in the system is creating vaccine hesitancy among the people of Shivaji Nagar, one of Mumbai's most underdeveloped neighbourhoods In 2020, with millions of migrantsstrandedin cities, in despair, India faced a social and humanitarian crisis it was not prepared for. Today, with the second phase of COVID-19, there is fear, denial, fatigue, and mistrust in the system and political apparatus, rampant misinformation, and vaccine scepticism in Shivaji Nagar, one of thepoorest and most underdevelopedneighbourhoods in Mumbai.Located in the city\u2019s M East ward, Shivaji Nagar with six lakh residents, is11.5 percent of Mumbai\u2019s informal settlement population. Many of them are migrants from across the country. Last year after the lockdown was announced in March 2020, residents faced a range of challenges, as highlighted ina studycarried out by the nonprofit organisation,Apnalaya. Incomes were impacted, and ability to pay rent was a chief concern. Many respondents to the survey reported being \u201con the brink of starvation\u201d during the lockdown. Eighty-one percent of people struggled for food and 70 percent had to borrow money to buy rations and water. A majority of people (72 percent) were more concerned about unemployment and loss of wages, than they were about their own health or that of their families.Given the income and food insecurity, relief efforts back then were largely focused on ensuring that disadvantaged communities had access to food, rations, and safety equipment to quell the spread of COVID-19. Now, with the precipitous surge in infections, the system\u2019s focus has shifted to medical solutions.",

What can nonprofits and funders do to help them achieve their aspirations despite setbacks to their education, mental health, and more? by Smarinita Shetty , Derrek Xavier The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating effect in Jharkhand, especially on the poor and vulnerable. The imposition of the lockdown resulted in unemployment rates reaching as high as 59.2 percent in May 2020. The National Health Mission\u2019s socio-economic survey, which looked into 443 deaths across eleven districts in the state, revealed that 62.2 percent of those who died of COVID-19 belonged to lower-income groups that earn less than INR 10,000 a month. In essence, the pandemic exposed the sharp fault lines of social and economic inequities that made certain population groups more susceptible to the effects of the crisis. One such group was adolescent girls and young women . Keeping girls in school In Jharkhand, prior to the pandemic, adolescent girls didn\u2019t attend school for a host of reasons, including migration to cities, child marriage , working to supplement family incomes, and household chores. In districts such as Pakur\u2014one of the 117 aspirational districts in India\u2014families migrated en masse seasonally. Adivasi communities would marry their girls early because of an economic incentive\u2014they would receive a bride price from the boy\u2019s family. Many girls were also responsible for taking care of their siblings. All of this meant that sending the girls to school was not a priority for the families.",

        "text": "While these concerns were applicable to both formal and informal sector workers, the absence of legal and social protection in addition to low, uncertain wages made women in the informal economy more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. In 2021, during the second wave of the pandemic in India, SEWA Bharat conducted relief efforts across the states of Delhi, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand. As part of this, 319 women were surveyed to gauge their preparedness for the second lockdown, their coping strategies, and the amount of stress they were experiencing. Data was collected using a psychological assessment tool called the perceived stress scale , which measures the degree to which people find situations in their life stressful. Contrary to other studies , these research findings revealed that the stress levels faced by women were not as high as expected. Forty-five percent of participants believed that things were going their way and 54 percent felt confident about their ability to deal with the challenges they were facing. It is imperative that states and civil society organisations increase individuals\u2019 access to financial inclusion networks. | Picture courtesy: Simone D. McCourtie/World Bank / CC BY On digging further, it was discovered that the women surveyed were also members of the SEWA credit cooperatives in their respective states. This led to the conclusion that providing people with access to affordable financial products and services can help them cope with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that informal sector workers are able to handle stressful situations in the future, it is imperative that states and civil society organisations increase individuals\u2019 access to financial inclusion networks. Financial inclusion can make women more resilient during emergencies 1.

This further threatens already marginal livelihoods or leads to unintended results post-implementation. During demonetisation in India, for example, the cash economy that supported the informal economy and micro and small-enterprises was devastated, wiping out years of economic gain for this vast segment of the population. In the same vein, much of monetary policy implementation relies on formal financial institutions, which exclude the informal economy. This is because a high proportion of informal workerslack accessto formal financial services, with women being particularly excluded.Where informal work is invisible or stigmatised, policymakers may design programmes that only apply to, or prioritise, \u2018formal\u2019 workers.Second, where informal work is invisible or stigmatised, policymakers may design programmes that only apply to, or prioritise, \u2018formal\u2019 workers. This may be the result of policymakers relying on pre-existing relationships and mediators between states and businesses, such as tax and business registers or chambers of commerce. This was true in pre-COVID-19 times, but is being amplified during the pandemic, where a range of popular relief efforts, such as tax delays and assisted furlough schemes, are specifically targetingformal businesses and workers.Third, the lack of systematic data collection in the informal economy often leads policies to systematically discriminate against groups that are overrepresented in the informal sector, includingwomen, migrant populations, and ethnic minorities. Migrant women are for instance not included in migration counts in India, as they are considered to be trailing either a father or a husband.\n\nThird, the lack of systematic data collection in the informal economy often leads policies to systematically discriminate against groups that are overrepresented in the informal sector, includingwomen, migrant populations, and ethnic minorities. Migrant women are for instance not included in migration counts in India, as they are considered to be trailing either a father or a husband. Efforts to alleviate the concerns of migrant populations therefore neglect half the population since they weren\u2019t even counted or recognised in the first place.Related article: Questioning the informal-formal binaryWhat is the way forward?Given the importance of research in informing policy discussions and emphasising the value of informal employment, we suggest a few ways forward in approaching the challenges to engaging in research and advocacy in this area.First, it is particularly important for policymakers to rapidly collect data on the informal economy and to integrate this information within a holistic view of the economy and the effects of the current crisis. As noted, when policymakers do not have appropriate data about the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on informal workers, there is the risk that relief efforts will overlook them, further marginalise them, and exacerbate inequalities among sub-populations.We need to acknowledge differences that come with variance in regions, languages, trades, state policies, and levels of marginalisation.Additionally, there is a need to recognise the heterogeneity of informality at every stage of the research and advocacy processes.\u00a0 Rather than embracing broad statements about the informal economy, efforts should be made to understand its diversity in order to have the greatest impact for informal workers\u2014and particularly the most vulnerable. We need to acknowledge differences that come with variance in regions, languages, trades, state policies, and levels of marginalisation, then tailor research and advocacy to reflect this.\n\nWe need to acknowledge differences that come with variance in regions, languages, trades, state policies, and levels of marginalisation, then tailor research and advocacy to reflect this.The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-evaluate modalities of work on a global spectrum and that includes how we do research as well as how research contributes to the new global order.

        "text": "Unlocking new capital for the social sector Innovative and blended finance structures, such as Social Venture Funds, offer a unique opportunity for nonprofits to secure new funding. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown has had a particularly devastating impact on migrant workers and their households. The imposition of the lockdown has led to many workers being left stranded in their workplace or suffering through long and dangerous journeys back home. Prevailing domicile restrictions for accessing state welfare (including rations), reduced mobility due to lockdown measures, and the stigma associated with being a migrant haveleft workers in distressand in need of help.The central government has accelerated relief efforts and inter-state discussions for migrant welfare are underway. However, it is evident that there is still a large dependency on nonprofits and community-based organisations to ensure the delivery of support for the informal sector. In an openletter, the CEO of NITI Aayog cites different ways in which the government seeks support from the social sector, including filling the gaps in public healthcare delivery, creating awareness, and supplementing the efforts of local governments. Whether it is enabling access to state-financed welfare or philanthropic support, nonprofits have stepped up to fill the void in the state\u2019s capacity to deliver welfare.Related article: How to ensure financial sustainability during COVID-19However, the key question is: How will they fund this support to state actors? We believe that although the social sector has responded courageously to the COVID-19 crisis, its efforts have been greatly limited by the funding mechanisms available to it. There is an urgent need to unlock new sources of capital for COVID-19 relief and recovery. In what follows, we illustrate this idea specifically for the situation of the informal sector, exploring structured finance solutions to fund nonprofits engaged in relief.",
