We should have safe spaces. and that should also be properly managed. Another way we can reduce the land pollution is by reducing the use of poisonous chemicals and practicing organic farming. Organic farming these days is a very famous phenomenon which is happening because of the various types of diseases happening because of these poisonous chemicals making the agriculture very difficult. moving towards organic farming that is very useful for us where we are not using any harmful pesticides or fertilizers. Next thing we can do is to control land pollution is proper waste management as I told you. So these are the ways to control the land pollution. Next type of pollution is noise pollution. So noise pollution is caused by excessive levels of noise from loud music, honking in the traffic unnecessarily. that we blow horns even if we are knowing that there is a jam in the traffic but still we keep on blowing the horns or keep on honking another cause can be high-speed aircrafts which creates so much noise industries with heavy machineries also create so much noise so these are the main causes which creates noise pollution now noise pollution can be controlled by reducing the loud music and avoiding unnecessary honking in the traffic. Following the guidelines for noise levels, we should be making noise up to a certain level, not beyond that, because after that it creates negative impacts. Controlling the noise near the sensitive areas like jungles, because animals are there, they get afraid of it, and they, you know, have... negative effect on their hospitals, schools. Hospitals are another sensitive places, same as schools. So these are the areas at least.',

The targeted area, production and productivity of these growth engines are furnished in the annexure. About The Department: Economical crop production is the life line for a farmer, who sheds his energy not only for his livelihood but also for the survival of the fast growing population. It is therefore, the fundamental duty of the government to safeguard the interests of the farmer. The Department of Agriculture as one arm of the Government has been established to perform the functions in the process of harmonizing the farming community. The major Kharif crops viz. paddy, cereals are maize, jowar, bajra, ragi and pulses are produced in the State known for their rich nutrient content are the staple diet of millions of people. In addition to the these crops Pules like Redgram, Blackgram, Green gram etc., are under cultivation in major extent.

        text: 'In this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented. Cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. In other words there is a total absence of modern equipments like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oil seeds, pulses, vegetables and sugarcane. Commercial farming is just the opposite to subsistence farming. In this case, most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money. In this system, farmers use inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides and High Yielding Varieties of seeds etc. Some of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of India are cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut etc. Rice farming in Harayana is mainly for commercial purpose as people of this area are pre- dominantly wheat eaters. Howevr in East and North-Eastern states of India, rice cultivation would be largely of subsistence type. 2. Intensive and Extensive Farming: The basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. In comparison with temperate areas of USA, Canada, and former USSR, India does not practise extensive cultivation. When we use large patch of land for cultivation then we call it extensive farming. Here, total production may be high due to larger area but per unit are production is low. Intensive Farming records high production per unit of land. Best example of intensive cultivation is in Japan where availability of land for cultivation is very limited. Similar kind of situation can be observed in the state of Kerala in India. 3.\n\nWhite Revolution: It stands for remarkable increase in milk production and establishment of a national milk grid, removing regional and seasonal imbalances. Among the technological inputs are (i) crossbreeding of indigenous cows with high milk yielding European breed; (ii) pasteurization of milk for keeping it for a longer duration; (iii) collection of quality milk from members in rural areas; and (iv) refrigerated transport system which helps sending milk to far off metropolitan centres both by road and rail. Blue Revolution: It refers to big rise in catching of fresh water and marine fish. Yellow Revolution: It refers to remarkably steady and assured supply of poultry products. Pink Revolution: It refers to a considerable rise in the production of quantity of apples particularly in the states of Himachal Pradesh and J&K.

Central part of India is dominated by plateau area. Apart from variation in landform, the country has varieties of climatic conditions, and soil types. These physical variations along with other factors like availability of irrigation, use of Notes machinery, modern agricultural inputs like High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of seeds, insecticides and pesticides have played their respective roles in the evolution of different farming practices in India. Some of the major types of farming are discussed below. 1. Subsistence and commercial farming: Majority of farmers in India practises subsistence farming. This means farming for own consumption. In other words, the entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their family and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market. In this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented. Cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. In other words there is a total absence of modern equipments like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly',

Identify and write any four similar geographical conditions required for both tea and coffee. 4. Analyse any four major challenges confronted by Indian Agriculture. 5. Explain the concept of food security. How is it different from self sufficiency in food. 6. On the outline map of India locate the production areas of: (i) Two labour intensive crops (ii) Two crops that are grown in varied terrains ANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS 12.1 1. The basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production from per unit of land. USA, Canada, former USSR are the major countries where extensive farming is practiced whereas Japan is the leading example of intensive farming. 2. As per the learners experience. 12.2 1. (i) Uniformly high temperature varying between 21\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C (ii) It grows mostly in the areas having at least 210 frost free days in a year; (iii) It requires modest amount of rainfall of 50 to 100cm. However, cotton is successfully grown by the help of irrigation in the areas where rainfall is less than 50 cm (iv) high amount of rainfall in the beginning and sunny and dry weather at the time of ripening are very useful for a good crop; (v) cotton cultivation is very closely related to Black soils.

Best example of intensive cultivation is in Japan where availability of land for cultivation is very limited. Similar kind of situation can be observed in the state of Kerala in India. 3. Plantation Farming: It is an estate where a single cash crop is grown for sale. This type of agriculture involves growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale. Tea, coffee, rubber, banana and spices are all examples of plantation crops. Most of these crops were introduced in India by the Britishers in the 19th Century. 252 SOCIAL SCIENCEMODULE - 2 Agriculture in India India: Natural Environ- 4. Mixed Farming: It is a situation in which both raising crops and rearing animals ment, Resources and Development are carried on simultaneously. Here farmers engaged in mixed farming are economically better of than others. All classifications are based on nature and purpose of farming. It may overlap. For example: Banana is a plantation type of farming. It can also be classified as commerical farming. Notes Green Revolution: It stands for a major technological breakthrough in India based on (i) improved seeds of high yielding varieties, (ii) adequate and assured supply of water for irrigation, and (iii) increased and appropriate application of chemical fertilizers for increasing agricultural production. White Revolution: It stands for remarkable increase in milk production and establishment of a national milk grid, removing regional and seasonal imbalances. Among the technological inputs are (i) crossbreeding of indigenous cows with high milk yielding European breed; (ii) pasteurization of milk for keeping it for a longer',

Come on, let's begin. So guys, let's start with the meaning of rural development. So guys, what did we study on this? Rural development means to prepare an action plan or to do such planning so that the overall development of rural areas can be done. Be it good infrastructure, education, health, business, job opportunities, standard of living. So, to prepare an overall plan so that social as well as economic development can be done in rural areas. Rural development refers to continuous and comprehensive social planning. socio-economic process, focusing on improving all the aspects of rural life. The plan is to focus on various challenges in rural areas. There are two types of challenges. Lingering and Emerging. Lingering means those that have been around for a long time. Emerging means those that are new and that you are seeing right now. In Lingering, we will study the problems of money and marketing. In Emerging, we will study the problems of sustainable livelihood. What can be different from agriculture? And organic farming. First of all, in rural credit, the major problem we have is money. Major problem is finance. Farmers are poor. Farmers do not have money available. In our country, there are two types of farmers. There are farmers who have a lot of money. And there are farmers who have very little money. So what happens in agriculture is that your time period... sowing seeds and harvesting crops.",
